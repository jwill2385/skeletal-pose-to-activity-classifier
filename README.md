Code repository for Effects of Variable Pose Input on Neural Network Model Performance for Classifying Basketball Player Activity paper.

This repository contains code for stratified KFold training of both the GCN and Transformer models outlined in the paper. Note the same model architectures along with hyperparameter tuning were applied to each of the joint combinations tested in order to determine the best joint combinations to apply stratiffied KFold analysis on.
